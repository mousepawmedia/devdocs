Geany
#################################

Geany is a lightweight text and code editor, and is one of our officially
recommended editors.

Installing
===============================

Geany is a FOSS multi-language text and code editor. It aims for simplicity
and ease-of-use.

Installing on Linux
-------------------------------

If you're on Ubuntu, you can just install via...

..  code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt install geany geany-plugins

Geany is available from the official package repositories for many other
Linux distros.

Installing on Mac
-------------------------------

You can download the official DMG for Geany and its plugins from
`<https://www.geany.org/Download/Releases>`_.

Installing on Windows
-------------------------------

You can download the official Windows installer for Geany and its plugins from
`<https://www.geany.org/Download/Releases>`_.

Adding Themes to Geany
===============================

..  note:: These instructions only work on Mac and Linux.

I don't know about you, but I hate working with black-text-on-white-background.
Thankfully, with Geany, you don't have to!

To install additional themes, first make sure you have Geany already closed
completely.

Go to the `geany-themes project on GitHub <https://github.com/codebrainz/geany-themes>`_.
Just above the list of files, towards the right, click :guilabel:`Download ZIP`.
Save that in your Home folder.

In your file browser, extract the ZIP file. In Ubuntu, you can do that by
right-clicking the file and clicking :guilabel:`Extract Here`. That should
have created a new folder called :file:`geany-themes-master` in your Home
folder.

Open up a Terminal and run the following command...

..  code-block:: bash

    $ ~/geany-themes-master/install.sh

That will report if it runs successfully.

Now, restart Geany. Go to :guilabel:`View` â†’ :guilabel:`Change Color Scheme...`
and select a color scheme that you like. Click :guilabel:`Close` when you're
happy with your selection.

Finally, in your file browser, delete the :file:`geany-themes-master` folder
out of your Home folder.
