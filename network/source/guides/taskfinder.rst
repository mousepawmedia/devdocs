Guide: Task Finders
#######################

If you're looking for something to do, you can use the Task Finders to find a
task to work on.

Each department has their own Task Finder, accessible from the left menu of
Phabricator. Depending on the department, different task categories will be
displayed.

In addition to use of the Task Finders, we'll also touch on the subject of
*adding* tasks to them. For more information, see :ref:`gtaskcreate`.

..  _gtaskfinder_helpwanted:

Help Wanted
=======================
There are hundreds, if not thousands, of open tasks on our Phabricator at
any one time. While we try our best to keep them organized, some still have
unlisted or unanticipated dependency tasks.

All tasks marked as ``Help Wanted`` are ready to be tackled *now*. They
are also considered appropriate for outside contributors. These tasks have
varying difficulty, dependencies, and requirements, but any of them may be
picked up and worked on by anyone at any time.

..  NOTE:: Help Wanted does not include "Low-Hanging Fruit"
    (see :ref:`gtaskfinder_lhf`).

The Task Finder displays the ten highest priority ``Help Wanted`` tasks. You can
click the magnifying glass to the upper-right corner of the list to see the
exhaustive list of Help Wanted tasks.

..  _gtaskfinder_lhf:

Low-Hanging Fruit
======================
If you're a brand new contributor, or otherwise looking for a less-challenging
task, you can check the ``Low-Hanging Fruit`` section.

Tasks marked as ``Low-Hanging Fruit`` [LHF] are considered likely to be either
easy or straight-forward. Of course, it is impossible to know how simple
something actually *is* until one starts working on it, but the LHF section
at least narrows the search.

..  WARNING:: Basically, we just mark something as Low-Hanging Fruit if it seems
    to be simple or straight-forward *to someone who has the appropriate skills
    and knowledge.* You should review the task's description, required skills,
    and comments before you decide it is right for you.

see the exhaustive list.

..  _gtaskfinder_jedi:

Jedi Required
=====================
When a task is assigned the status ``Use the Force``, we are indicating that it
is expected to have notable difficulty. Open and unclaimed tasks with this
status are listed under the section ``Jedi Required``.

The Task Finder displays the ten highest priority ``Use The Force`` tasks.
You can click the magnifying glass to the upper-right corner of the list to
see the exhaustive list.

..  _gtaskfinder_mysterious:

Mysterious
======================
The task status ``Patched`` indicates that, while the task may have been
temporarily completed - such as a bug that has a workaround, but which has
not yet been fully resolved.

The Task Finder displays the ten highest priority ``Patched`` tasks, including
ones which are already assigned. You can click the magnifying glass to the
upper-right corner of the list to see the exhaustive list.

..  _gtaskfinder_challenging:

Challenging
======================

Open and unassigned tasks with high Friction (f4 and f5)
(see `QTM: Friction <http://standards.mousepawmedia.com/qtm.html#friction-available-help>`_)
are listed under the ``Challenging`` section.

The Task Finder displays the ten highest priority ``Challenging`` tasks.
You can click the magnifying glass to the upper-right corner of the list to
see the exhaustive list.

..  _gtaskfinder_upforgrabs:

Up-For-Grabs
=====================

The top 20 highest priority, unassigned tasks are displayed in the
``Up-For-Grabs`` section. This list is automatically generated without any
help from us, so some of these tasks may have unlisted dependencies or other
problems. Thus, before claiming a task from this section, it is best to contact
a staff member working on the project.

..  _gtaskfinder_project:

Adopt a Project
=======================
Sometimes we have projects which require dedicated attention. If you're
interested in helping to manage a project, consider one listed in this
section. Contact a department manager for more information, or to claim
a project.
