###################################

It may come as a surprise, but not all freely available fonts are free to
use commercially! Font licensing can be extremely expensive, which is why it
is of *utmost* importance that we only use free and open source fonts at
MousePaw Media.

The fonts listed on this document have been pre-approved for use at
MousePaw Media.

Installing the Font Bundle
===================================

All of the fonts mentioned in this document can be quickly downloaded and
installed from Nextcloud. Even if you've already installed these fonts, you can
reinstall the newest pack to get updates any time.

In Nextcloud, download the file :file:`Design/Fonts/MPM_FONTS_BUNDLE_v3.2.zip`.
Save this file to your :file:`Desktop`.

In a terminal, run the following commands.

..  code-block:: bash

    cd ~/Desktop
    unzip MPM_FONTS_BUNDLE_v3.2.zip
    cd MPM_FONTS_BUNDLE_v3.2
    ./install.sh

When prompted, enter :kbd:`H` to install the fonts to your home folder,
or :kbd:`s` to install the fonts system-wide, and then press :kbd:`ENTER`.
If you don't select an option before hitting enter, the fonts will be installed
to your home folder (:file:`.local/share/fonts`).

When you're done, you can delete the file :file:`MPG_FONTS_BUNDLE_v3.2.zip`
and the folder :file:`MPG_FONTS_BUNDLE_v3.2` from your Desktop.

Installing Individual Fonts
===================================

If you don't want to mass-install all the fonts, but only want one, you can
do that as well.

In Nextcloud, download the file :file:`Design/Fonts/MPM_FONTS_BUNDLE_v3.2.zip`.
Unzip it to any convenient location, and find the ``.ZIP`` folder for your
desired font within the :file:`MPM_FONTS_BUNDLE_v3.2` directory.
