"Hawksnest" IRC Bot
###############################

The :code:`#mousepawgames` and :code:`##mousepawgames` Freenode IRC chatrooms
are patrolled by our bot, **Hawksnest**.

Addressing Hawksnest directly (i.e. :code:`Hawknest: hello!`) will sometimes
evoke a response.

Phabricator Object Lookup
==================================

The bot will post links to most Phabricator objects when they are mentioned
(i.e. :code:`D123`, :code:`T134`, :code:`E5`). Although the titles and
links for objects are posted, actual access to the object is still controlled
by user access rules.
