Server Configuration
##############################################

We've documented most details relating to how we built our servers. This
serves (a) as a reference for ongoing maintainance, (b) a training
resource for anyone wanting to learn more about LAMP servers, and (c) a
way for others to provide feedback on our server architectures.

..  NOTE:: Of course, these guides are provided without warrenty.

If you find errors, omissions, typos, or other problems, or otherwise want
to make a suggestion, please file a bug report on Phabricator.
