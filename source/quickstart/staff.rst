You **must** have Debian Linux, ideally an Ubuntu-based distro (version 16.04
or later), installed directly on your computer. See :doc:`setup/install`.
If you need help, contact Jason C. McDonald.

Staff Network
=======================================

The Staff Network consists of six components:

* Webmail (mousepawgames.com/webmail)

* eHour (ehour.mousepawmedia.net)

We also use IRC and Jitsi for regular communication.

Webmail
========================================

..  NOTE:: Webmail is hosted on our Provo, Utah servers, and thus is
    available 24/7!

Email is one of our primary ways of communicating at MousePaw Games. You have
a company email address issued to you.

..  WARNING:: Be sure to check your company email every single day, and
    respond in a timely fashion!

You can check your email through any of the three build-in web clients. If you
need help choosing a webmail client, check out this table...

+----------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| If you like... | Try          | Because...                                           |
+================+==============+======================================================+
| Outlook.com    | Horde        | Integrated calendar, tasks, and notes.               |
+----------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| Gmail, Yahoo   | RoundCube    | Simple graphical interface, less bells and whistles. |
+----------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+

+----------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+

You can also connect your account to an external email client, such as Thirdbird
or your mobile device. If your email client cannot automatically detect the
necessary settings, follow these instructions...

1.  Log into Webmail with your full company email address and your password.

2.  On the lower list of links, click :guilabel:`Configure Mail Client`.

3.  Scroll down and write down the information from the box titled
    :guilabel:`Secure SSL/TLS Settings`. Use these to set up the email
    client of your chocie. For desktops and laptops, we recommend Thunderbird.

..  IMPORTANT:: Access your company email using one of the methods above.

Regular Webmail Tasks
--------------------------------

* Read Jason C. McDonald's weekly check-in every week. You'll find reminders,
  company news, helpful tips, and his "Useless Trivia of the Week".

* Send your check-in email on the same day each week, detailing what you've
  done over the past week and what you're planning to do over the upcoming week.
  Including the Phabricator Maniphest task IDs/links for the tasks you've been
  working on. This is also a good time to ask your supervisor questions.

..  IMPORTANT:: Log into your webmail and send an email to your internship
    supervisor. Let them know what day you would like your weekly check-in
    email to be on.

..  WARNING:: Your check-in email is how we track your job attendance. Be sure
    to send it on your regular day **every single week**!

eHour
===============================

..  NOTE:: eHour is on our development server, meaning it is subject to the
    Hawksnest server hours.

eHour is where we track time. You are responsible for reporting your time
**every week**. Each week's time sheets are locked every Monday morning.

..  WARNING:: If you forget to log your time, you will not be reminded.
    Contact your internship supervisor if you missed the deadline.

To log your time, go to eHour. Login using your company username and password.
You will be on the :guilabel:`Your Hours` section by default, with the current
week highlighted.

Enter your time (in hours) on the appropriate boxes for each day. You may also
want to include notes on each day (by clicking the pencil) or the week (in the
big box below the hours) describing what you've done.

..  WARNING:: These notes are not a replacement for your check-in email.

Finally, click :guilabel:`Store` in the lower-right corner to store the hours.
